# Smart-Garden-System

This project serves as an integral part of the ITI Embedded System diploma graduation project, which revolves around the development of a comprehensive Smart Home System.

- The Garden System is a vital component of our Smart Home project, specifically designed to automate and optimize garden irrigation. 

- It integrates various sensors, control mechanisms, and microcontrollers to create an efficient and user-friendly solution for managing garden watering.

- The system continuously monitors soil moisture levels using a soil moisture sensor. Based on the moisture readings, 

- it intelligently controls a water flow control mechanism (commonly referred to as a "motor" in this context).

Key features of the Garden System include:

  -  Soil Moisture Monitoring: The system employs a soil moisture sensor to accurately measure soil moisture levels.

  -  Automated Irrigation: When the soil becomes dry, the system activates the water flow control mechanism to irrigate the garden.
    
  -  Conversely, it stops or reduces water flow when the soil is adequately moist.

  -  LED Indicators: The system provides clear visual feedback with red and green LEDs, indicating when the soil needs watering and when it's adequately moist.

- This Garden System ensures that your garden receives the right amount of water, optimizing plant health and eliminating the need for manual watering. 

- It's an essential part of our larger Smart Home project, which focuses on creating an intelligent and connected living environment.
